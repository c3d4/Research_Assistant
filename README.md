# Research_Assistant
This research assistant uses HTML GET and POST requests, to retrieve data in the XML and JSON format. XML and JSON parsers were used to take useful information from the data, namely article titles and URLs to the articles. Once gathered, the results are cleaned and then merged into one centeral file. The file is loaded into a new form that reads the resutls in a sequence, and dispalys them to the user.

Additional functionality includes looking at all of the previous searches and results, as well as searching in the history for previous results. The searching algorithm used is a tree search, with O(log n) complexity.
